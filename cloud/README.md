Cloud Provisioning and Configuration Management
==========

Let's build some automation around the provisioning and configuration of cloud resources.   

### Introduction   
As CDW Labs ramps up its capabilities around all things cloud, one of the first things our engineers will need to do is provision cloud infrastructure.   The scripts, templates, code, etc. found here are used to automate these tasks.


### Clouds
The focus for now is on following public cloud providers and their [IaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service) offerings:   
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)   
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)    
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)   
* [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)  


### The Toolbox   
Some of the tools we're using or are considering for use include:
* [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)   
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)
* [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/)   
* [PowerShell Desired State Configuration](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn249912.aspx)
* [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/)   
* [Chef](https://www.getchef.com/)
* [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
