==========

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image for acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining cloud infrastructure.

### Introduction 
As CDW labs ramps up its cloud capabilities, one of the first things our engineers will need to do is manage cloud infrastructure.  The Docker imaged provided here provides a way 
to do that in a consistent fashion.  And since it's a container, (nearly) all dependencies are packaged within.


### Clouds
The focus for now is on the following public cloud providers and their [IaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service) offerings:   
* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)   
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)    
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)   
* [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)   


### The Toolbox  
Some of the tools we're using or are considering for use include:
* [Terraform](http://www.terraform.io/)   
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)   
* [Jsonnet](http://google.github.io/jsonnet/doc/index.html)   


### Ansible roles   
Like most other configuration management systems, Ansible supports third-party contributions. "[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com) jump-starts your automation 
projects with great content from the Ansible community."   

Ansible calls these pre-packaged units of automation [roles](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles#roles).  This Docker image has been pre-populated with the following roles:
